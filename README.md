## Running the program

Open 3 terminals in the folder containing main.go (one for each peer).
Run one command per terminal with the following:

(in the first terminal)
go run . 0

(in the second terminal)
go run . 1

(in the third terminal)
go run . 2

Afterwards you can make a peer request to enter critical state by entering a line in any terminal (press enter).
